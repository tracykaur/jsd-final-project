# Final GE JS Project

## About The Project
An app  using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to retrieve question data from the Open Trivia Database API.

* This app is a trivia game that allows users to test their knowledge of different topics.
* The app uses the Open Trivia Database API to get questions.
* Users can choose the category and difficulty level of the questions.
* The app tracks the user's score and displays it at the end of the game.
* The app is written in JavaScript and uses the Axios library to make requests to the API.

## Technology
This application was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## Phase two
The next phase of the app would be to highlight the correct answer, keep a tally of the score and create a two player version. It would also be good to build it in react.
